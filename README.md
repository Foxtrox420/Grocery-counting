# Grocery-counting
Hey everyone, this is my first ever code that I wrote, I am currently in my first semester studying in university majoring in computer science and I thought sharing this
with everyone would be a nice look to coding in hopes of making people see the fun in coding. I have only studied about 3 days and I have absolutely no background in 
coding at all so this is my first time trying this out. 

in this program, it is trying to solve an issue of when someone is selling items and wants a fast way to count it by just inputing the amount of products they want to buy.
the application of this could be seen in the supermaket and I use the same principles to program my short mini project. 


IMPORTANT ! 
In order to run this, use the "Groceries Project Remastered" file as it is more polished. 
The other file that doesn't have the "remastered" name linked to it is an older version which is more redundant and less polished, so don't use this. 
If you want to learn, a "Groceries Project Edu" file is the one you should use to understand my thought process behind the code. All of them are labeled through the
// statements. 


Thank you for downloading and trying this out, I know it's nothing super cool, but I think this is a milestone for me as I don't have any basis on working for this
besides a pre existing problem and I had to figure out the mechanics of statements in the C language.
